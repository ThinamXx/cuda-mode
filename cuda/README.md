# **cuda** 
This repository contains my notes and exercises from the book mentioned below. 

## **üìóBook**
- Programming Massively Parallel Processors.  

## **üõ©Ô∏èSetup Requirements**
1. NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
2. CUDA Toolkit - Download and install from [NVIDIA CUDA Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
3. A C/C++ compiler (gcc/g++)
4. For VS Code users:
   - C/C++ extension
   - CUDA extension by NVIDIA

## **üöÄProgress**

### **Day 01**  
Today, I was focused on setting up the environment and getting familiar with the CUDA programming model. I read the *chapter 1 & 2* of the book and created a simple *hello world* program and *vector addition* program. I learned about cuda function declaration, memory allocation, memory copy, memory free, kernel launch, thread, block, and grid hierarchy in cuda. 

- [x] Setup the environment.
- [x] Create a simple *hello world* program.
- [x] Print a message from the CPU and the GPU.
- [x] Create a program for *vector addition*.
